# hello-world
using Python for Baysian Stats (using priors knowledge) in PRECISION AEROSPACE MANUFACTURING (CNC TURNING).

I have worked with classical stats for a number of years, but they do not always work well with small sample sizes, nor where a process goes thru several changes, such as tooling, speeds, feeds, clamping, etc.

Recently I researched Baysian methods- it is a much better fit in the 'real world'. They make sense because every situation is never perfect.  
Classical stats is more for 'ideal' ... the per-verbial "widget factory".

REAL WORLD:  I have seen people in critical HEALTHCARE fields such as pharaceuticals, using 'p-value's to prove or disprove decisions where tens of millions of dollars sit in the balance, not to mention the possibility of death from adverse drug affects.  IMHO p-value is short-sighted, at best.

I work with precision (aerospace) rotating turbine parts, with small (5-15) sample sizes.  
I have an appreciation for the uncertainty of measurement, having spent most of my life in measurement, and researching.   

My goal is to model the measurement processes (each one is different) using Baysian methods, in a way that includes measurement uncertainty. 

PYTHON is really cool for mathematics problem solving. I will need some helpful tips or suggestions along the way, so please feel free to 'chime in'.

Thanks for reading.  -SteveGyro
